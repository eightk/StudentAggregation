1. User can use UI version or no-UI version to run the solution
2. Run the AggregationApp for no-UI version and AggregationUI for UI version.
3. UI version only supports aggregating 5 test files in /input folder and generates corresponding output files in /output folder. If user wants to test specific file, can set the resource file location in no-UI version or directly copy the content to one of the 5 testing input files.
4. The validation on grade+number by default is: the first letter should be either 'k' or 'K' or 1-8, the next 4 digits should all be number and total length is 5. User can set the pattern in driver to change the validation rules.
